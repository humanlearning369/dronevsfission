# Fission Energy Drone Simulation

## Overview
This project contains a Python script that simulates the behavior of drones in a fission energy environment. The simulation includes visualizing the spread of energy and how drones react to changes in the energy field, managing safety thresholds, and resource allocation.

## Features
- Energy distribution calculation based on fission point and time parameters.
- Drone class that simulates drone behavior in response to the energy field.
- Animation of energy spread with drone visualization.
- Safety and resource management for drones.

## Requirements
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pycharge
- scipy
- meep

## Installation
To run this simulation, you'll need to install the required Python libraries. You can install them using `pip`:

**pip install numpy matplotlib pycharge scipy meep**

USAGE:

To run the simulation, execute the Python script:

**python drone_fission_sim.py**

The simulation will display an animation of the energy spread and the drones' reaction to it.
